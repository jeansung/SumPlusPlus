<!--## Things to resolve with Prof Ben-->
<!--#halp me pls-->

I am unsure about 2 things

* how things fit together
* what is the language part of what I am creating 

## Part 1
I want you to be able to statically define a TABLE and a set of RULES. 

Table definition should occur through a GUI where there is a table like interface. 
Rule definition should occur through selecting from preset templates with options for drop down menu for the types of rules and typing for the values. 

For a given set of TABLE + RULES, you should be able to live run a program that gives you a table interface for selecting which you want and then it will live update consistent or not consistent. 

I am unsure of how these pieces fit together. 

I know that Excel can do the back end work. 

I could have a list of type and difficulty gradients inputted as a CSV 
Rule creation can be done in Excel through a drop down menu. 

A Java applet with an excel back end (is that possible? Does that make sense?) could update consistency checks. 

## Part 2
Looking ahead for the language implementation and design document and questions for next week, I am worried about how what I am making can be called a language. 

I do have some answers for the questions but I am unsure about
* internal v. external
* What would a semantics / parser do or look like (language wise)?
* worried about making a product that people can download and use (if it requires an excel backend that's a pretty specialized software to have...)
