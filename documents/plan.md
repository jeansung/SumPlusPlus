# Project plan

## Language evaluation
**How will you know that your language has accomplished its goals?**  
The goal for my language is for it to be useable, ideally for its target audience. Thus, I will known if my language has met it's goals if a typical user can use the language to produce a meaningful output. For easer of access, I will be using the teacher-creating-the-test example. Ideally, I would get a real professor to test it. However, if I can't find a professor to test it, I will use a set of example problems and see if the tool can be used in creating example tests. 

**What tools, techniques, or measurements will you use to evaluate your language design?**  
Part of my language design goals is that I create a useable product. I will use a user test (probably among a convenience sample just to test if people can use it) to determine if I meet this goal. I will aim to get at least **4 of 5**  users to say that it was a useable tool. The other part of my language design goal is to get a useable product for the target audience. In order to evaluate this, I will either get or act as a target audience with 2 sample data sets and see if I am able to create programs as described in the example computations section of [description.md](https://github.com/jeansung/project/blob/master/documents/description.md). 

**What tools or practices will you use to ensure that your language implementation is of high quality?**  
I will make sure I have a narrow scope for my project, at least initially so I can focus on getting something work, before I get it working well. I will also borrow from agile development practices to focus on making sure that I have deliverables so that I can get meaningful critique. I will write test cases if possible to check and verify the correctness of my code. Finally, I will dedicate specific time to creating documentation for how to download and install my program, as well as making sure that user testing is integrated in my project to ensure usability. 


## Implementation plan
**How much time do you think you'll need for the various components of your language (e.g., finding a host language, implementing the semantics, the parser, tools, etc)?**

Here is an component / time estimate chart:

| Part | Time Estimate |
|:-----|:--------------|
| Finding a host language and proper tools for implementation | 1 week, especially finding an encoding for the constraints |
| Implementing the semantics | 1 week |
| Implementing the parser | 1 week |
| Joining together, first hello world program | 1 week |
| User testing & feedback, integrate | < 1 week | 
| Documentation/ Install instructions, better error handling | < 1 week | 
Expansion of language with more features | stretch goal, will determine if/when I get here | 

Note: This is an initial survey of the pieces needed for the project. Any changes will be noted in the project notebook during the appropriate week. 

**Provide a brief schedule (e.g., with a deliverable every week) for your project.**

| Deliverable | Date | 
|:------------|:-----|
| Finding a host language and proper tools for implementation | November 9th |
| [Language design and implementation overview](http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~benw/teaching/cs111_fa14/project.html#lang-overview) | November 16th | 
| Implementing the semantics | November 19th  |
| [Prototype](http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~benw/teaching/cs111_fa14/project.html#prototype) | November 23rd | 
| Implementing the parser | November 23rd |
| Joining together, first hello world program | November 30th - December 2 |
| [Preliminary evaluation](http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~benw/teaching/cs111_fa14/project.html#evaluation) | December 1st | 
| User testing & feedback, integrate | December 2 - December 7 | 
| Documentation/ Install instructions, better error handling | December 7th | 
| Final [Product](http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~benw/teaching/cs111_fa14/project.html#product) and [Write up](http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~benw/teaching/cs111_fa14/project.html#write-up) | December 12th | 
| [Demo / Presentation](http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~benw/teaching/cs111_fa14/project.html#talk) | December 18th | 

Note: The later date in the chart represents a more realistic goal with flexible timing. This is a initial project of my work schedule on the project, which is subject to change at any time, especially as I make progress and conditions of the project change (i.e. if one part takes shorter or longer than projected). Changes will be noted in the project notebook at the appropriate week.
