# Project description and plan

## Motivation

Why is this project useful or interesting, what problem are you trying to address, and why is a DSL an appropriate solution?

## Language domain
What is the domain that this language addresses, and why is the domain useful? Who will benefit from this language? Are there any other DSLs for this domain? If so, what are they, and how might they influence your language design and implementation?
## Language design
If you had to capture your DSL's design in one sentence, what would it be? What constitutes a program in your language? What happens when a program runs? What kinds of input might a program take, and what kinds of output might it produce? Are there data or control structures that you know will be useful? What kinds of things might go wrong in a program in this domain (e.g., syntax errors, compile-time errors, run-time errors)? How might you design your language to prevent such errors or to clearly communicate the results of errors to the user?
