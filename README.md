A weighted sum with custom constraints tool created by [Jean Sung](http://cs.hmc.edu/~jsung) for the [Final Project](http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~benw/teaching/cs111_fa14/project.html) in *Domain Specific Languages*, Fall 2014. The project's updates and how to install/run instructions can be found here. Keep up with the progress by visiting the [project notebook](https://github.com/jeansung/project-notebook). 

Sum Plus Plus is a tool to help you organize your thoughts regarding possible combinations of weighted types to satisfy custom constraints.
