Only allowed to choose from pre-specified rule types
Right now - must fully specify everything (no dependency rules like everything else yet)


constraints on types of inputs
- categories (A, B C) individual must have </=/> inputs 
- together (A, B, C) must have </=/> inputs 
// - overall you must have </=/> to a number of inputs 

constraints on values of inputs 
- categories (A, B C) inputs individually  must sum to </=/> value 
- together inputs from (A, B, C) must together sum to </=/> value 
// - overall, the sum must be </=/> a certain amount
