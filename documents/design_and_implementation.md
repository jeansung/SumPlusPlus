# Language design and implementation overview

## Language design
*Be sure to answer the following questions and note any changes from your original design:*  

How does a user write programs in your language (e.g., do they type in commands, use a visual/graphical tool, speak, etc.)?

What is the basic computation that your language performs (i.e., what is the computational model)?

What are the basic data structures in your DSL, if any?

How does a the user create and manipulate data?

What are the basic control structures in your DSL, if any? How does the user specify or manipulate control flow?

What kind(s) of input does a program in your DSL require? What kind(s) of output does a program produce?

Error handling: How can programs go wrong, and how does your language communicate those errors to the user?

What tool support (e.g., error-checking, development environments) does your project provide?

Are there any other DSLs for this domain? If so, what are they, and how does your language compare to these other languages?


Nope, doesn't apply to this langauge 
## Language implementation
*Give a high-level overview of the implementation decisions you've made, including:*

Your choice of an internal vs. external implementation and how and why you made that choice.

Your choice of a host language and how and why you made that choice.

Any significant syntax design decisions you've made and the reasons for those decisions.

An overview of the architecture of your system.
