A weighted sum with custom constraints tool created by [Jean Sung](http://cs.hmc.edu/~jsung) for the [Final Project](http://www.cs.hmc.edu/~benw/teaching/cs111_fa14/project.html) in *Domain Specific Languages*, Fall 2014. The project's updates and how to install/run instructions can be found here. Keep up with the progress by visiting the [project notebook](https://github.com/jeansung/project-notebook). 

Sum Plus Plus is a tool to help you organize your thoughts regarding possible combinations of weighted types to satisfy custom constraints. 

## Instructions & Help 

### Installing
**Note:** At this time, there is only *tested* support for Mac OSX 10.8+. 

**Before you install** Your machine must have  
* `pip`
* `python v 2.7.x`

Find help for installing [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) and [python 2.7.x](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.8/python-2.7.8-macosx10.6.dmg).

1. Download the Github Repo as a zip file.

### Sample Programs
To run the sample programs, run `python run.py`. Type `2` or `3` to run the sample programs. The Excel file should open after the program runs. 

Here is a sample run of the program with `table` and `rules` included.

Once the Excel file is open you can manipulate the inputs until the "bads" turn to "good". The blue box shows the area where you can manipulate.

### Creating your own files 

**General I/O Notes**: Input files, the `table` files and the `rule` files must live in the `input_files` directory. Output files, the created Excel sandbox files, are generated in the`output_files`. You must be in the top level directory when you run `run.py`, which is the file that runs the program.
