name typeRule Categories (types) (relation) must have (operator) (totalInputs) inputs. ;

name = [typeRule, [types, ], relation, operator, totalInputs]


typeRule, relation, operator, will probably be parts of a struct 
types will be an array of 1 or more things 



name valueRule Categories (types) (relation) must sum to (operator) (totalValues). ;

maybe_some(*thing)
>>> parse("hello world", maybe_some(word))
['hello', 'world']
>>> parse("", maybe_some(word))
[]



// at least one thing 
some(*thing)

A = [valueRule, [types], relation, operator, totalInputs]
B = [typeRule, ]

C, set of rules = [A, B]




give string identifier and use python dictionary 

where and A and B are the string name identifier 


valueRule and typeRule are types of genericRule
